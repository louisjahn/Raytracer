# Raytracer

This project is based on Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) Book Series.

In this project, I try to follow the book's instructions and also add my own touch to this Raytracer implementation.

I don't have any precise goal besides just having fun and enjoying graphics development :)
